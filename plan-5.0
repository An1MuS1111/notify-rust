# planned breaking changes

* [ ] remove dbus or at least make zbus/dbus mutually exclusive
* [ ] remove __closed
* [ ] urgency u8 vs u64 stuff
* [ ] accept `Into<Action>` in `Notification::action()` (move `Action` from server up)
* [ ] rename `Notification::show()` and `Notification::show_async()` (maybe show() and show_blocking)
